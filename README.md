# LS-BuildWeek-DataScience-Demo
This is a demo for Lambda School Build Weeks' Data Science hybrid projects. It is for Web students to test what it is like making requests to a python-based application. It also includes extensive documentation and instructions for DS students about how to create a Flask App that simply outputs valid JSON.
